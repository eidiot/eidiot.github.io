I don't remember when I started to blog, maybe in 2005. I don't remember when I blogged last time neither, maybe in 2010. I don't even remember when I lost my domain for my old blog.

In 2006 I started to learn ActionScript 3 and wrote a few tutorials about it. I found that interest is the best teacher and teaching is the best way to learn. Now I am back to school as an international student in an English speaking country, so writing blog again in English must be a good idea.

I'd like to use Github to host my blog this time and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) seems not good enough because of its slow compiling. Then I found [Hexo](http://hexo.io/), "_A fast, simple & powerful blog framework, powered by Node.js._" It is simple and fast, and I am happy with it so far.

So,
```
Hello World
```
Again.
